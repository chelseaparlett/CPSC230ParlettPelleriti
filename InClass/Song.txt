Sick and tired of hearing all these people talk about
What's the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out
The thing you got to realize, what we doing is not a trend
We got the gift of melody, we gonna bring it 'til the end

It doesn't matter,
'Bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck
All that matters,
Is that you recognize that its just about respect
It doesn't matter,
About the clothes I wear and where I go and why
All that matters,
Is that you get hyped 'cause we'll do it to you every time
(Come on now)

Do you ever wonder why, this music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock
(your body starts to rock)
Baby you can't stop
(You can't stop),
And the music's all you got, come on now
This must be, pop

Dirty pop, that you can't stop
I know you like this dirty pop
This must be, pop

Now, why you want to try to classify the type of thing we do
Cause were just fine doin what we like, can we say the same for you
Tired of feelin all around me animosity
Just worry about trust cause I'ma get mine, people can't you see

It doesn't matter,
'Bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck
All that matters,
Is that you recognize that its just about respect (oh)
It doesn't matter,
About the clothes I wear or where I go and why
All that matters,
Is that you get hyped 'cause we'll give it to you every time
(Come on)

Do you ever wonder why, this music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock
(your body starts to rock)
Baby you can't stop
(You can't stop),
And the music's all you got, come on now
This must be, pop

Oh
Man I'm tired of singing
Dirty, dirty, dirty pop
Dirty pop
Do you ever wonder (echo)
Nsync
(Oh) do you ever wonder why
(every wonder why)
This music gets you high? 
(Music gets you high)
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock
(When your body starts to rock)
Baby you can't stop
(Baby don't stop),
And the music's all you got, come on now
This must be

Do you ever wonder why, this music gets you high? 
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock
(Your body starts to rock)
Baby you can't stop
(You can't stop),
And the music's all you got, come on now
This must be, pop
