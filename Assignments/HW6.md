# COMPLEX NUMBER
Create a class called Complex() that represents a complex number. It should have two attributes, the `real` and the `imaginary` parts.

Make three instance methods, add(), square() and multiply() that add and multiply these complex numbers. See the link below for more information on how addition/squaring, and multiplication work with complex numbers.

At the end of your file, create at least two Complex() objects, and demonstrate the add(), square() and multiply() methods by calling them and printing their results.
