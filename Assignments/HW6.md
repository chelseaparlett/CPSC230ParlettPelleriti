# COMPLEX NUMBER
Create a class called `Complex` that represents a complex number. It should have two attributes, the `real` and the `imaginary` parts.

Make three instance methods, `add()`, `square()` and `multiply()` that add and multiply these complex numbers. Each method should return a Complex instance with the `real` and `imaginary` parts calculated using the information below. The `add()` and `multiply()` functions should also take in *another* complex number as an argument so that, for example, you could call:

```
a = Complex(1,2)
b = Complex(3,4)

c = a.add(b)
d = a.multiple(b)
```


See the link below for more information on how addition/squaring, and multiplication work with complex numbers.

At the end of your file, create at least two Complex objects, and demonstrate the `add()`, `square()` and `multiply()` methods by calling them and printing their results.
