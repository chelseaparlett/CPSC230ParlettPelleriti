## Overview:
CPSC 230 is an introductory course designed to introduce students to the field of computer science in general and computer programming in particular. After a brief coverage of fundamental computer architecture, students will learn the foundations of software development using the programming language Python. Topics include basic program organization, data types, conditionals, repetition, functions, and file I/O. Object-oriented principles will be introduced. When possible techniques will be applied to problems from other academic disciplines.

## Prerequisites:
MATH 104 or permission of instructor.

## Units:
CPSC 230 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
The Practice of Computing Using Python, Author: Punch & Enbody,
Publisher: Pearson, Edition: 3rd (March 10, 2016)

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Blackboard and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of programming assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at the beginning of class (assignments not due on a class day will be due by 11:59pm), and may be demonstrated to the instructor during the class session.

Late homework will be discounted at a rate of 5% per hour. All programs must be written in Python unless otherwise specified. Grading will be based on correctness, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.)

There will be occasional quizzes on the reading and lecture material, which will count toward the participation grade. Missed quizzes may not be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester.

There will also be  one in-class exam and take home project and a final exam and take home project, which must be taken on the dates specified. In the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.

You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.
