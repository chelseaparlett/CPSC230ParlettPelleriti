## Course Description
Students are introduced to problem-solving methods and algorithm development through an interactive and easy-to-learn programming language, Python. CPSC 230 is a 3-unit course.

## Course Learning Outcomes
 A student successfully completing this course will be able to:
1.	Analyze and understand existing programs
2.	Design new programs by transforming, expanding, and modifying existing programs
3.	Recognize primary data types and program structures
4.	Match computing concepts with their definitions
5.	Demonstrate ability to express software solutions for problems from various domain areas

## Program Learning Outcomes
The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Education Learning Outcomes
Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate).


## Overview
CPSC 230 is an introductory course designed to introduce students to the field of computer science in general and computer programming in particular.  After a brief coverage of fundamental computer architecture, students will learn the foundations of software development. Topics include basic program organization, data types, conditionals, repetition, functions, and file I/O.  Applications within the course will span from numerical to biology to more creative aspects.


## Prerequisites:
MATH 104 or permission of instructor.

## Units:
CPSC 230 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
How to Get Your Textbook:

1. Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com
2. Enter zyBook code: CHAPMANCPSC230Fall2022
3. Subscribe

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Canvas and/or Github.

## Course Communication:
Information for the course will mainly be disseminated through our Course Slack. YOU MUST join the course slack channel and check for updates. Email through Canvas may also be used. Materials will also be available through the course GitHub (https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC230ParlettPelleriti).

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of programming assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. Assignments are due by 11:59pm, unless otherwise specified. This includes instances of not hitting submit or submitting incorrect files. You are responsible for ensuring the correct files are submitted by the deadline. The timestamp on a file that missed a deadline is not valid.


Stuff happens. So, you have 3 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). To qualify for an extra day, you must let me know BEFORE the assignment is due, and fill out the Late Days Google Form. Because of these 3 "extra days", late work will automatically be penalized a 0.5% per hour (or part of an hour) late. Because of grading deadlines, extra days CANNOT be used during finals week.

All programs must be written in Python unless otherwise specified. Grading will be based on correctness, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.)

There will be weekly quizzes on the reading and lecture material. Missed quizzes may NOT be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester, so use these 2 dropped quizzes to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be  two in-class exams and take home projects and a final exam and take home project, which must be taken on the dates specified. *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

## Assignment Grading
All assignment will be graded by myself. Any questions concerning late submission or assignment grade inquiries should be directed to me via email/Slack. By all means approach me before or after class to ask questions but, I will request a follow-up email to make sure I don’t overlook any action items.

## Course Grade Breakdown
Letter grades in the class will be assigned according to the following breakdown:


| Grade                   | Letter Grade |

| 90-92.9                 | A-           |
| 87-89.9                 | B +          |
| 83-86.9                 | B            |
| 80-82.9                 | B-           |

## Collaboration Policy:
You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

## Student Support at Chapman:
Over the course of the semester, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with your learning, such as problems with friend, family, and or significant other relationships; substance use; concerns about personal adequacy; feeling overwhelmed; or feeling sad or anxious without knowing why. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. You can learn more about the resources available through Chapman University’s Student Psychological Counseling Services here:

Fostering a community of care that supports the success of students is essential to the values of Chapman University.  Occasionally, you may come across a student whose personal behavior concerns or worries you, either for the student’s well-being or yours.  In these instances, you are encouraged to contact the [Chapman University Student Concern Intervention Team](https://www.chapman.edu/students/health-and-safety/student-concern/index.aspx) who can respond to these concerns and offer assistance.

## Religious Accommodation
Religious Accommodation at Chapman University Consistent with our commitment of creating an academic community that is respectful of and welcoming to persons of differing backgrounds, we believe that every reasonable effort should be made to allow members of the university community to fulfill their obligations to the university without jeopardizing the fulfillment of their sincerely held religious obligations. Please review the syllabus early in the semester and consult with your faculty member promptly regarding any possible conflicts with major religious holidays, being as specific as possible regarding when those holidays are scheduled **in advance** and where those holidays constitute the fulfillment of your sincerely held religious beliefs.
