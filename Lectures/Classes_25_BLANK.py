# Turn student dictionary example into a class
'''
Create a dictionary called student. It should have the keys: name, age, major, minor,
year, classes_current, classes_all, and clear_status.

Write the following functions:
-- rename() which takes in the dictionary, and a variable, new_name. Replace their
current name with new_name.
-- end_semester() which takes in the dictionary, and which moves all their current
classes to their list of ALL classes, and empties current classes.
-- major_declare() which takes in their dictionary, and a string, major, and
updates their major.
-- minor_declare() which does the same thing, but for minor.
-- covid_clear() which takes in the dictionary, and a boolean, survey, which
indicates whether or not the student has said "no" to all the covid screening
questions on their daily survey. It then changes their status to "CLEAR" or
"NOT CLEAR" based on the survey.
