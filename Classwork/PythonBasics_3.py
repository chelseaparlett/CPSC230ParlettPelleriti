'''
1. What type is x? How can we use python to check?
'''

x = 10

'''
2. Which of the types we covered (Int, Float, Boolean, String, Dict,
 List, Set) are collections? What's different about a collection?


3. The == is the "equal to" operator, and it returns True if two objects
are equal, and False if they are not (see below for examples). Add a
line of code to check if the Boolean True is equal to 1.
'''
# examples
1 == 2 # False
3 <= 10 # True

4. Use Python to cast z into a string. Print type(z) before and after making
the change.
'''

z = 156


'''
5. Print the type of each of these variables.
'''

my_int = 9
my_string = "quod erat demonstrandum"
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
my_dict = {"name": "Jane Doe", "age": 27}
my_set = {1,1,2,3,5,8,13}


'''
6. Print out my_set. Did it change at all? Why?
'''
