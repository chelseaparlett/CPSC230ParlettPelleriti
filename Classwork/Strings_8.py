message = "Listen: Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis\
     for a system of government!  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate\
     from the masses, not from some... farcical aquatic ceremony! You can't \
    expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw\
     a sword at you!! I mean, if I went 'round, saying I was an emperor, just\
     because some moistened bink had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"


# What will this print out?

1. Grab and print the name "Chelsea" from the following strings using string
slicing.
'''

s1 = "My Name is Chelsea"
s2 = "Her Favorite Football Team is Chelsea or maybe Man U."
s3 = "Chelsea"
s4 = "aelehC" # hint [::]
s5 = "Chelsea Parlett"

'''
2. Ask the user for a word as input and store it in the variable, palindrome.
Then, check whether their word is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards
like the word kayak). If it is, print out a message informing them.
'''


'''
3. A friend has left you a hidden message in the string below, but they've
told you that to find it, you have to look at every other letter starting at
the END of the string and moving towards the beginning. Luckily you know how
to use Python for that. Print out their message below.
'''

hiddenMessage = "tDafegrhGr hgjnkipoqDd hekrv'cudosY"


'''
4. Using a while loop to loop through the indices (remember indexing starts
at 0 in python), write some code that counts the number of vowels in a user
inputted string. Make sure you use the in operator.
'''

'''
5. Use + and * operators with strings to print out the lyrics to "Work" by
Rhianna more efficiently (e.g. instead of typing "work work work work work" how
can we use the * operator?)
'''

lyrics = '''Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work
He see me do mi dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
So me put in work, work, work, work, work, work
When you ah gon' learn, learn, learn, learn, learn?
Me nuh care if him hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting
'''


'''
6. Write some code that asks a user to input a word that is at least 5 letters long.
Continue to ask them for a word until they enter an empty string "". As they give
you words, store the third letter  and the fifth letter in a string.

Once they enter an empty string, print out the string of all the 3rd and 5th
letters.

For example if they give you the words "hello", "filth", "canning", "grown"

your string should be "lolhnion"
'''


'''
7. Ask the user to input two words of the SAME LENGTH. Using a WHILE loop, count
how many letters are the same between the two strings. For example in spam and
span, 3 of the letters (s,p,a) are the same. In the words bitter and better,
5 of the letters are the same. Print out a message telling the user how many
letters are the same.
'''



'''
8. Write some code that asks the user for a string, removes the first and last character
using string slicing, and prints it out.
'''

'''
9. the function .isupper() checks if a string has all uppercase letters. It returns
True if all the characters are uppercase, and False otherwise. Using a while
loop to loop through the string below, count the number of uppercase letters.

'''

# example of .isupper()
print("E".isupper())
print("e".isupper())

the_string = "When I was a Young Boy My Father Took Me Into The CITY to See A Marching BAND"


'''
10. Pretend your user is a Club Penguin player. Ask the user to input a message.
Use the in operator to check if any of the following "bad words" are in the message
a Club Penguin user is trying to type. If any of them are, print "You're BLOCKED". Otherwise
print the message as is.

BAD WORDS:
- dang
- gosh
- shoot
- fork
- bench
