# ask the user for a number between 1 and 10. Check that their
# number actually is between 1 and 10. Then check if their
# number is odd. If it is, print "Odd", otherwise print
# "Even".
# 1. first write out the steps you'll need to take.
# 2. then write the code to accomplish these steps

print(not True)

# 

tired = True

if not tired:
    print("I'm going to go for a run!")

1. Use an if statement to print out "This is even!" if a number
is even.
'''

2. Ask the user to input a word. Store it in the variable x. Use
an if statement to check whether that word is "portmanteau". If it
is, print "Your word is my favorite word!". Otherwise, print
"K."
'''

'''
3. You can use the len() function to check the length (# of characters)
in a string (see example below). Ask the user to input a word and store
it in the variable my_word. Using len() and an if statement, write some
code that checks whether the length of a word is less than or equal to
10. If it is, print out "Wow, short word."
'''

g = len("Hello World") # 11


'''
4. Write some code that asks the user to input their favorite course (e.g.
CPSC 392). Check whether their favorite course is CPSC 230. If it is, print
out "Me too!".
'''

'''
5. Ask the user to input a number. Make sure to cast it to an int. Then,
Check whether they're number is divisible by 13. If it is print out
"Wow, this number is divisible by 13". Otherwise print out nothing.
